# Carbon Emission Calculator 
### Carbon Emission Calculator, a project(website) aimed at assessing the carbon footprint of laptops within the organization encompassed creating the backend with APIs in Django, conceptualizing the software development life cycle (SDLC) for calculating CO2 emissions from laptops based on processing battery report data. This project also involved automating the task of gathering battery report data from all laptops using Python, and the development of a user-friendly web interface where users could upload battery reports, view the power consumed and carbon emitted, and store this data in a Postgres database for future reference without re-uploading the battery report.
